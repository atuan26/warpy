# warpy

Warpy is a maintained fork of warpd, porting core functionality to Python, and introducing Smart Hint Mode for intelligent UI-based navigation.

## 🚧 Roadmap

- [ ] Port C core logic to Python 🐍
- [ ] Add Smart Hint Mode 🤖
  > Context-aware hints based on active window elements (like buttons, text, etc.)
  - [ ] Searchable Hints
    > Start typing the name/label of the button, and narrow hints.
    Feels like Vimium x Spotlight vibes.
- [ ] Highlight Current Cursor Animation ✨
  > Smooth animation or glow effect to make the current cursor position pop
